Race against the rabbit

An assignment for Code Fellows: Foundations 1


Additions to the code:
• The user can pick a player and enter stats for that player
• A maze that the user can get lost in. Wrong turns add additional distance to the user total distance they must travel to win the race. Correct turns can lead to short cuts that can shorten the total distance in the race.
• If the losing player does not get out of the race with a high enough position they are recaptured by the bad guys.
